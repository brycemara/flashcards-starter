## Flashcards
[Bryce Jarrett](https://github.com/brycemara) Solo Project; mod2
#### Description
This application is 100% JavaScript that stimulates a set of 30 flash cards through the command line.

#### Usage
You will be able to see the question, take a guess, and see if you guessed correct or incorrect. When the deck of flashcards is empty you will see the percent of cards you got correct.

#### TimeLine
The project was assigned Monday October 5th and was completed Thursday October 8th. Each day I completed an iteration and refactored on Thursday.

#### Resources
For this project I used the FlashCards project spec as a resource. As well as MDN, classmates and my mentor.

#### Final Outcome
In this example below the deck is only 5 cards for purpose of demonstration.
